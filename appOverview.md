## Overview

This overview provides an easy-to-understand description of all five main areas of our shared apartment app. Each area presents the features that help us organize our shared living arrangements and joint obligations with ease.

## 1. Shopping

* **Shared shopping list**: A list that we can both access at the same time. We simply add new items and can assign them to one person at a time.
* **Upload PDF shopping list**: We use the REWE app for shopping, which provides shopping lists as PDF files. Alternatively, analog shopping lists can be scanned. The app recognizes the individual items and automatically adds them to the shopping list.
* **Long-term purchases**: Larger purchases, such as furniture or electrical appliances, are kept in a separate list. There we record what we want to buy, when we need it, and who pays what share.
* **Cost sharing**: Each item can be assigned to one of us or both of us. The app shows directly how much each person has to pay.

## 2. Finances

* **Personal account balance**: Each of us can see our current credit or debt.
* **Add expenses**: We can manually record expenses or income, e.g., rent, electricity, or joint purchases.
* **Manage debts**: Outstanding amounts can be marked, settled, and tracked in a history.
* **Overview & history**: A chronicle of all transactions shows who paid what and when, and how our balances are developing.

## 3. Cleaning

* **Cleaning schedule**: For each room in the apartment, we can see when it was last cleaned and whose turn it is next.
* **Task assignment**: The app automatically suggests who should clean next so that all rooms stay clean in turn.
* **Appointment reminder**: We receive a reminder when a room needs to be cleaned again.

## 4. Plants

* **Plant overview**: A list of all plants in our apartment with pictures and names.
* **Watering schedule**: For each plant, we can see when it was last watered and when the next watering date is due.
* **Reminder**: We receive a notification on the day of the watering date.
* **Additional information**: We can add notes, for example about fertilizer, location, or special care tips.

## 5. Home / Dashboard

* **Daily overview**: A summary of all tasks due for the day in the areas of shopping, finances, cleaning, and plants.
* **Quick access**: We can switch directly to the individual areas using buttons or menus.
* **Important notifications**: The app displays important information and reminders at a glance, e.g., outstanding debts or upcoming purchases.
